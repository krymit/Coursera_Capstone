## Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)

### Introduction:  
The distribution of different types of restaurants in the Berlin neighborhoods will be explored to determine a place where to open up a certain type of restaurant.

### Data:  
Coordinates of the neighborhoods are necessary, which will be acquired with the geopy library. Information on restaurant categories in a neighborhood can then be obtained with Foursquare. The information can be analyzed,e.g. in which neighborhoods a category of restaurant is more common / popular, and the similarity between neighborhoods can be assessed using an algorithm such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN).
